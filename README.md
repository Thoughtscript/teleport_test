Contents of this repo include an optional GoLang code challenge submitted after receiving an initial offer for a Technical Writing and Developer Advocate (Developer Relations) job.

I felt it was important to help substantiate my ability to work in the stack.

## Job Role

So, a tentative offer was made at Developer Relations IV which I turned down (since I felt it was outside my range of experience). I  was also surprised at the generosity of the offer (it's competitive and appears to be in line with both the average and median at multiple firms). They insisted on Developer Relations II!

Per our previous conversation, the CTO felt that my previous work, articles, and certificates was sufficient to advance forward for the Developer Relations role.

Despite that, I'd also like to complete at least one of the product engineering challenges to help substantiate my application and ensure I'm in line with the team.
